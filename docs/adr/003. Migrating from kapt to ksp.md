# ADR: Migrating from kapt to ksp

* Status: Proposed
* Deciders: @alejandro.batanero @rosa.palli @carolina.acosta 
* Date: 2024-03-26
* 
  Technical Story: BLOPUP-440

## Context and Problem Statement

The Android app development team is currently using kapt (Kotlin Annotation Processing Tool) 
for annotation processing in the project. However, there's a growing concern regarding the 
limitations and performance issues of kapt, especially in conjunction with Dagger and Hilt, 
which do not have full compatibility with kapt. 
The team is exploring the possibility of migrating to ksp (Kotlin Symbol Processing) to address these concerns.

## Decision Drivers

* Concerns over performance limitations with kapt.
* Desire to explore newer, potentially more efficient technologies.
* Need to maintain or improve overall build times and developer productivity.

## Considered Options

### Migrate to ksp

* **Pros:**
    - Potentially faster build times.
    - Improved incremental build support.
    - Better IDE integration.
    - Potential compatibility improvements with Dagger and Hilt.

* **Cons:**
    - Learning curve for adopting a new technology.
    - Potential compatibility issues with existing code and libraries.

### Stay with kapt

* **Pros:**
    - Familiarity with existing tooling and workflows.
    - Less immediate disruption to development.

* **Cons:**
    - Continued risk of performance bottlenecks, especially with Dagger and Hilt.
    - Potential maintenance overhead as the project scales.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Migrate to ksp", but keep kapt, because it offers the potential for improved
build performance, better support for incremental builds, and potentially in the future
compatibility with Dagger and Hilt, addressing our primary concerns with kapt.

We will migrate Room that is fully supported by ksp and leave Dagger and Hilt with kapt for now.

### Positive Consequences

* Potential improvement in build times, leading to faster development cycles.
* Enhanced support for incremental builds could reduce the need for full rebuilds, improving developer productivity.
* Possible resolution of compatibility issues with Dagger and Hilt, leading to smoother integration of these libraries.

### Negative Consequences

* Initial investment required to learn and integrate ksp into existing workflows.
* Possible compatibility issues may arise during the migration process, requiring additional effort to resolve.
