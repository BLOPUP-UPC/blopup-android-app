Technical Story: BLOPUP-424

## Context and Problem Statement

The context is the need to select a testing framework for an Android application, specifically considering testing Jetpack Compose components. The problem arises in deciding whether to use JUnit 4 or JUnit 5 for this purpose.

## Decision Drivers

* Compatibility with existing codebase
* Availability of features required for testing Android components, including Jetpack Compose

## Considered Options

### JUnit 4

* Pros:
    - Widely adopted and well-documented.
    - Currently used in the existing codebase.
    - Familiarity among developers, reducing the learning curve.
    - Jetpack Compose UI testing capabilities.
    - Integration with Espresso for UI testing.
    - Instrumentation testing with `AndroidJUnitRunner`.

* Cons:
    - Limited support for newer Java features.
    - Less flexibility compared to JUnit 5.
    - Maintenance and support may decrease over time.

### JUnit 5

* Pros:
    - Supports newer Java features like lambdas and annotations.
    - Offers more flexibility with extensions and parameterized tests.
    - Improved architecture for better modularization and test organization.
* Cons:
    - Might require additional effort for migration from JUnit 4.
    - No direct support for Jetpack Compose UI testing.
    - Less mature ecosystem compared to JUnit 4.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "JUnit 4", because of its compatibility with the existing codebase, mature ecosystem, and extensive support for Android testing, including Jetpack Compose UI testing capabilities.

### Positive Consequences

* Immediate integration with existing test suites and build processes.
* Reduced learning curve for developers already familiar with JUnit 4.
* Access to a well-established community and extensive resources for Android testing, including Jetpack Compose UI testing.
* Examples available on how to test latest Android features in the 'nowinandroid' repository.

### Negative Consequences

* May miss out on some of the newer features and flexibility offered by JUnit 5.
* Potential need for migration in the future as JUnit 5 adoption increases.
